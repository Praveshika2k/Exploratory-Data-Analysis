World happiness report 2022


The Happy Planet Index (HPI) is an index of human well-being and environmental impact that was introduced by the New Economics Foundation in 2006. Each country's HPI value is a function of its average subjective life satisfaction, life expectancy at birth, and ecological footprint per capita. The exact function is a little more complex, but conceptually it approximates multiplying life satisfaction and life expectancy and dividing that by the ecological footprint. The index is weighted to give progressively higher scores to nations with lower ecological footprints.

The index is designed to challenge well-established indices of countriesâ€™ development, such as the gross domestic product (GDP) and the Human Development Index (HDI), which are seen as not taking sustainability into account. In particular, GDP is seen as inappropriate, as the usual ultimate aim of most people is not to be rich, but to be happy and healthy. Furthermore, it is believed that the notion of sustainable development requires a measure of the environmental costs of pursuing those goals.

Out of the 178 countries surveyed in 2006, the best scoring countries were Vanuatu, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, and Panama. In 2009, Costa Rica was the best scoring country among the 143 analyzed, followed by the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Guatemala and Vietnam. Tanzania, Botswana and Zimbabwe were featured at the bottom of the list.

For the 2012 ranking, 151 countries were compared, and the best scoring country for the second time in a row was Costa Rica, followed by Vietnam, Colombia, Belize and El Salvador. The lowest ranking countries in 2012 were Botswana, Chad and Qatar. In 2016, out of 140 countries, Costa Rica topped the index for the third time in a row. It was followed by Mexico, Colombia, Vanuatu and Vietnam. At the bottom were Chad, Luxembourg and Togo.


Information is presented for 146 countries and 12 indicators of living standards and happiness.

Let's describe our feature space.

RANK - number in the ranking of countries.
Country - researched country.
Happiness score - an index that reflects the well-being of people and the state of the environment in different countries of the world, which was proposed by the New Economics Foundation in July 2006.
Whisker-high and Whisker-low - Whisker (low) is the quartile (real number between 0 and 10) from which the happiness score is calculated.
Dystopia (1.83) + residual - I can not find information in open sources, if someone knows, please tell me :)
Explained by: GDP per capita is the ratio of GDP to the population of the country, which shows how much of the gross product produced in the country in a year and expressed in value terms, falls on one inhabitant of this country.
Explained by: Social support is a form of expression of the social policy of the state, aimed at providing social assistance to needy citizens.
Explained by: Healthy life expectancy - Healthy life expectancy is an indicator for calculating which life expectancy must be adjusted for the health of the individual. This indicator represents the period of time (years, months, days) during which an individual is expected to have a certain state of health, with a constant level of mortality and morbidity.
Explained by: Freedom to make life choices - the right of a person to freely express his opinion. This right includes freedom to hold opinions and freedom to receive and impart information and ideas without any interference from public authorities and regardless of frontiers.
Explained by: Generosity - The main feature of charity is the voluntary choice of the type, time and place, as well as the content of (targeted) assistance. Charity is distinguished as a manifestation of compassion for one's neighbor and the moral duty of the possessor to rush to the aid of the have-not.
Explained by: Perceptions of corruption - an index compiled by the international non-governmental organization Transparency International to reflect the assessment of the level of perception of corruption by analysts and entrepreneurs on a 100-point scale. Compiled annually since 1995.

CONCLUSIONS
In order to be able to enjoy life, you need to be in it mentally. The only way to live life is to be in the present moment. If you have not experienced positive emotions for a long time, then you are probably living in situations from the past often - proving something to someone, still angry, ashamed or feeling guilt, gnaw at yourself for the fact that "it was necessary then to say differently." Or you live in the expected future - you are afraid, anxious about possible changes, or, conversely, you live in anticipation of when they will happen. In this way, you do not live your life - you avoid it, depriving you of the opportunity to experience the emotions of the present moment.
Most people, when they want to shake things up, experience some emotions, feel better, they choose a surrogate for emotions in the form of delicious food, alcohol, a series, a movie, a book, funny videos in the social network feed. All of these are ways to quickly get emotions through escape from reality. This is a good way to feel better, because it is guaranteed and fast, but it allows you not to enjoy life, but rather, on the contrary, to get away from it and enjoy something that has nothing to do with your immediate reality. It, just like mentally hanging in the past and future, allows you to escape from the problems of the present and create for yourself, albeit artificial, but guaranteed joy.
After getting rid of triggers from the past, starting to live in the present and not running into surrogates of positive emotions, you will need to learn again and again to fill your life with new, now real emotions, and lead a rich life. It will really be necessary - in all other cases, you run the risk of falling back into the pit of artificial happiness.

I congratulate you on the fact that now you know much better about how to be a happy person and enjoy life. I hope that now you will apply the suggested recommendations and take life into your own hands.
